# Updating the Query
Due to PostgreSQL's inability to update a materialized view, dropping the table is necessary

To accomplish that, modify the SQL query as needed in the admin panel, save changes, 
and then carry out these admin actions on your admin entry to update the database:

* `Drop Materialized View`
* `Create Materialized View`
